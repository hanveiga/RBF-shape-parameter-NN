# RBF-shape-parameter-NN

Repository associated to the paper: "Learning a robust shape parameter for RBF approximation"

In this repository, you will be able to reproduce the results of the paper, as well as generate your own dataset and train your own neural network to estimate the shape parameter for an interpolation matrix.

## Installing environment

~~~
conda env create -f env.yml
~~~

## Dataset generation
In the folder ``dataset/`` the notebook ``generate_dataset.ipynb`` will create the datasets as described in Tables A.11 and A.12 of the paper. The dataset used in this work is ``sort_1d_11_11.5.pkl`` and ``sort_2d_11_11.5.pkl``.

## Neural network training
In the folder ``network/`` the notebook ``generate_nn.ipynb`` uses the generated datasets in folder dataset/, ``sort_1d_11_11.5.pkl`` and ``sort_2d_11_11.5.pkl``.
Using those datapoints, it generates distance matrices and sets-up the learning problem. 
It outputs the best obtained model, ``best_model.pt`` in a user-defined folder (default: ``results_sorted_1d_2d/``).
